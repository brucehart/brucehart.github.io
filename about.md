Hi! I'm Bruce Hart -- husband to Stefanie, father of two young kids and cancer survivor living in Bellbrook, OH. I have been interested in technology my whole life and studied Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Dayton. In my career, I've primarily worked in the defense industry including my current role as a Chief Scientist at KBR and my work as CTO of PreTalen -- an innovative engineering company developing defense technologies that was acquired in 2019.

I've started this blog to document and share some of the exiting things I see going on in the world of technology, especially in the areas of AI and software engineering. I love solving problems and using technology to develop solutions. I also like to solve Project Euler problems and have completed over 200 to date.

If you see something interesting or would like to talk more feel free to reach out: bruce.hart@gmail.com .
